- Check logs for errors in Render dashboard

**"Module not found" error:**
- Verify requirements.txt was uploaded
- Check build logs in Render

**File processing fails:**
- Ensure file is under 500MB
- Check if file format is supported
- Review error message in bot response

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Render logs in dashboard
2. Verify all files uploaded correctly
3. Confirm BOT_TOKEN environment variable is set
4. Test with a small file first (under 10MB)
